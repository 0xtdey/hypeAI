✦ Updated Advanced Trading Algorithm - Detailed Explanation:

  1. Multi-Layered Decision Architecture:
   - Historical Data Layer: Fetches or generates historical price data (OHLCV) for analysis
   - Indicator Calculation Layer: Computes advanced technical indicators using TA-Lib
   - Market Regime Detection Layer: Identifies current market conditions (trending, ranging, volatile)
   - Signal Generation Layer: Creates multiple concurrent trading signals
   - Risk Management Layer: Calculates optimal position sizes
   - AI Decision Layer: Final decision with LLM interpretation

  2. Advanced Indicator Calculation:
   - Momentum Indicators: RSI, MACD (with histogram), CCI, ROC (Rate of Change)
   - Volatility Indicators: Bollinger Bands, ATR (Average True Range), standard deviation
   - Volume Indicators: OBV (On Balance Volume), volume-to-SMA ratios
   - Statistical Indicators: Correlation, skewness, Hurst exponent for market efficiency
   - Price Position Indicators: Position within Bollinger Bands, stochastic-like measures

  3. Market Regime Detection System:
   - Hurst Exponent: Determines if market is trending (H > 0.6), mean-reverting (H < 0.4), or random (0.4 ≤ H ≤ 0.6)
   - Volatility Analysis: Compares current volatility to historical averages
   - ATR Analysis: Assesses the magnitude of price movements
   - Regime Classification:
     - Trending: High Hurst exponent, strong momentum, rising ATR
     - Ranging: Hurst ≈ 0.5, low volatility, tight Bollinger Bands
     - Volatile: High volatility, rapid price changes, uncertain direction

  4. Multi-Signal Generation System:
   - Trend Signal: Based on EMA/SMA crossovers, MACD, and current price position
   - Mean Reversion Signal: Based on RSI extremes, Bollinger Band positions
   - Momentum Signal: Based on ROC, MACD histogram, CCI, volume confirmation
   - Volatility Signal: Based on Hurst exponent, volatility expansion, skewness
   - Regime-Adjusted Signal: Combines all signals with weights based on current market regime

  5. Signal Weighting by Regime:
   - In Trending Markets: 35% trend signal + 25% momentum + 20% regime + 20% volatility
   - In Volatile Markets: 30% mean reversion + 25% volatility + 25% regime + 20% momentum
   - In Normal/Ranging Markets: Equal weighting (25% each) of all signals

  6. Advanced Risk Management System:
   - Kelly Criterion Integration: Estimates win rate and risk-reward ratio to calculate optimal position size
   - Volatility-Adjusted Sizing: Reduces position size in high volatility environments
   - Regime-Based Adjustments: Modifies position sizes based on market conditions
   - Maximum Risk Limits: Caps individual position size at 10% and total portfolio risk at 25%

  7. AI Decision Integration:
   - Enhanced Feature Set: AI receives much more sophisticated market analysis than basic indicators
   - Regime Context: AI is provided with market regime classification
   - Confidence Scoring: AI receives confidence levels for different signals
   - Risk Parameters: AI receives position size recommendations
   - Final Decision: AI still makes the ultimate buy/sell/hold decision but with better inputs

  8. Execution Process:
   - Data Fetching: Historical data is fetched for each asset being traded
   - Indicator Calculation: All advanced indicators are computed from the historical data
   - Regime Detection: Current market conditions are classified
   - Signal Generation: Multiple concurrent signals are calculated with regime-adjusted weights
   - Risk Analysis: Optimal position sizes are calculated using Kelly Criterion
   - AI Processing: Enhanced analysis is sent to LLM for final decision
   - Trade Execution: Decision is executed through the simulation engine

  9. Dynamic Adaptation:
   - Real-time Regime Detection: Continuously updates market regime classification
   - Adaptive Thresholds: Adjusts signal thresholds based on current market conditions
   - Signal Confidence: Provides confidence levels based on signal agreement and market regime
   - Feedback Loop: Uses trade results to refine future decision parameters

  10. Fallback Integration:
   - If any advanced calculation fails, the system gracefully falls back to simpler methods
   - If AI fails, it uses the original quant-based decision
   - Maintains the original system's robustness while adding sophisticated analysis capabilities
